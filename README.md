# arcade-v4-scenecontrol-collection
A public collection of v4 scenecontrol that I've written
## How to use
1. Create a 'Scenecontrol' (case-sensitive) folder within your chart's/song's folder (the same place where the .aff files are)
2. Download or copy the files of the scenecontrol stuff that you need (init.lua + others)
3. Put files into the Scenecontrol folder
## Using multiple files from this collection / using together with other scenecontrol
Open the 'init.lua' file in a text editor, add the 'require' lines of the SC files that you want to use

If you're lazy or unsure, the 'require' line for every SC file in this collection is included in every folder's 'init.lua' file, feel free to copy and paste that into the 'init.lua' in your SC folder
